## About Me


- I have always lived in the US, however I have travelled and lived in many other countries longer than I have lived in the UK, hence the british flag in my picture.
- I have many hobbies but 1 hobby that is very important to me is fishing, I have gone fishing since I was 7 with my dad, and it is still something I like to do every summer.
- I have 2 sisters named Brooklyn and Zuzu, a mom named Cindy, and a dad named Jason. that is who the people in my picture are. We are all Chriastain which is where the cross comes from.
- Another hobby I have is gaming, I put that on there because it is also something I like to do with my sisters.

## This is a video I used to help me with coding

## Problems I encountered while coding
I had encountered problems at the very start and a major problem being how I had not installed WSL Ubuuntu properly, WSL kept showing up with "root" so as a result I had to restart everything and reinstall the whole thing again. I am not certain, but I think the problem was when I made my username as I put the wrong one so I tried uninstalling, but I did not uninstall all the way so I looked up videos for help over the weekend until I eventually got it working.

## A calculator I found
